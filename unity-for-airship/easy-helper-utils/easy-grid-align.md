Rebuild in editor to get things positioned how you want, or rebuild in Play mode if you want it to be dynamic.

ContentHolder is the parent transform that holds all of the elements you want aligned. Place child elements here to have them aligned.

NumberOfGridElements is the target Max number of elements in each axis.

Local Grid Element Size is how spaced out each element should be.

The Random offsets let you give variance to each positioned element.&#x20;
