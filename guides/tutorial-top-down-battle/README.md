# Tutorial - Top Down Battle!

Build a top down shoot em up / hack n slash. The goal is to complete a full game loop using core Airship systems. The final result can be seen HERE.

The core systems we will explore:

* [Project Setup](project-setup.md)
* [Player Characters](spawn-a-player-character.md)
* [Camera Controls](custom-camera.md)
* [Voxel World generation](voxelworld-level-generation.md)
* [AI Enemies](ai-enemies.md)
* Health and Respawning
* Inventory Items
* Held Items



### Prerequisites

This game is built mostly from scratch in a new airship template. You should know how to install Airship and compile Typescript code. Knowledge of Typescript and Unity is recommended, but not required.&#x20;
