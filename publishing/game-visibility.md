# Game Visibility

When you create a game it has a default visibility of `Unlisted` . You can change this at anytime on the [create dashboard](https://create.airship.gg/dashboard/organization/game/listing/).

<table><thead><tr><th width="180">Visibility Mode</th><th>Explanation</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Unlisted</td><td>Your game is publicly available but won't be listed on the home page. This means anyone can join through your play link or through friends.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Public</td><td>Your game is public and listed on the home page.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Private</td><td>Your game is private to your organization. Players outside of the game's organization will be unable to join.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
